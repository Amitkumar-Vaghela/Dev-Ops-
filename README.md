# What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) practices that focuses on automating, integrating, and improving collaboration between software developers and IT operations teams.
The main goal of DevOps is to deliver applications and services faster, more reliably, and at scale. It bridges the gap between writing code and running it in production.

## Key Principles of DevOps:
Collaboration: Break down silos between dev and ops teams.
Automation: Automate testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring.
Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Deliver code changes frequently and safely.
Monitoring & Feedback: Track performance and errors in real time, then improve.
Culture of Ownership: Developers and operations share responsibility for the productâ€™s lifecycle.

## Benefits:
Faster delivery of software
Higher quality and fewer bugs
Better collaboration and efficiency
Scalability and reliability in production

## ðŸ“Œ Agile Methodology
Agile is a software development approach that focuses on iterative progress, collaboration, and continuous delivery. Instead of building everything at once, teams deliver small, working parts of the product frequently.

## ðŸ”‘ Principles of Agile (from Agile Manifesto):
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

## ðŸš€ Agile Practices:
Scrum: Framework with sprints (1â€“4 weeks), daily stand-ups, sprint reviews.
Kanban: Visual workflow using boards/cards to track tasks.
User Stories: Small, simple descriptions of features from the userâ€™s perspective.
Continuous Feedback: Customers and stakeholders review frequently.

## ðŸ‘‰ Agile + DevOps = Faster delivery with collaboration, automation, and feedback loops.
