# What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) practices that focuses on automating, integrating, and improving collaboration between software developers and IT operations teams.
The main goal of DevOps is to deliver applications and services faster, more reliably, and at scale. It bridges the gap between writing code and running it in production.

## Key Principles of DevOps:
Collaboration: Break down silos between dev and ops teams.
Automation: Automate testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring.
Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Deliver code changes frequently and safely.
Monitoring & Feedback: Track performance and errors in real time, then improve.
Culture of Ownership: Developers and operations share responsibility for the productâ€™s lifecycle.

## Benefits:
Faster delivery of software
Higher quality and fewer bugs
Better collaboration and efficiency
Scalability and reliability in production
