# 🏢 RHEL / Derivatives Overview

## 🧠 What is RHEL?
**RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)** is a version of the Linux operating system made for **business and enterprise use**.  
It is developed and maintained by **Red Hat, Inc.**, and it provides:
- Professional **technical support**
- Regular **security updates**
- Long-term **stability and reliability**

RHEL is **subscription-based**, which means companies pay to use it and receive official support and certified updates.

## ⚙️ What Are RHEL Derivatives?
Since RHEL is open-source, other developers can use its code to make **free or cheaper versions**.  
These versions are called **RHEL Derivatives** — they are built from the same source code as RHEL but are freely available.

They provide the **same stability and compatibility** as RHEL but without the paid support.
