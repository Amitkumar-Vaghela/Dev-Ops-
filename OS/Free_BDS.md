# 🧠 FreeBSD Overview

## What is FreeBSD?
**FreeBSD** is a free and open-source **Unix-like operating system** that comes from the **Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)** project.  
It is known for its **stability**, **speed**, and **security**, making it a great choice for **servers**, **network devices**, and **storage systems**.

FreeBSD is similar to Linux but has its own design and development style.

### 🧠 Monolithic Kernel
- The core part of FreeBSD that manages memory, processes, and devices.
- Everything works together for better speed and efficiency.

### 🛠️ Userland Utilities
- Includes all basic system tools (like file and process management).

### 📦 Ports Collection
- A large library of software that’s easy to install, like an “app store” for servers.

### 💾 ZFS File System

## 🖥️ Desktop Use
While FreeBSD can be used as a desktop operating system, it’s **mainly designed for servers**.  
You can still install graphical environments like **KDE** or **GNOME** if needed.

## 🔑 License
FreeBSD uses a **permissive BSD license**, meaning:
- You can use it freely (even in commercial projects).
- You don’t have to share your source code if you modify it.

This makes it very popular for companies that need flexibility.
